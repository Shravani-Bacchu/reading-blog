there is nothing quite like the amazement and sensational wonder of this book. i just wanted to crawl into the pages and spend the rest of my days enthralled by the enchanting magic of this story. i love stories that make me second guess what i know and think, and this captivated me from the first page. the stakes are high, unseen forces are in play, and the truth of everything is more hidden than the identity of caraval master legend himself. this was truly an experience, one i will want to read again and again.
From the very first page up until the last, there was never a dull moment while reading Caraval. It was just an enigma wrapped in magic and deception. One minute you think you have the story and the characters all figured out, the next minute the storyline takes you on a completely different direction! There were just so many twists, turns, and puzzles that every page leaves you hanging at the edge of your seat.

Although Caraval didn't really feel like it took place in a circus/carnival like I was hoping it would, the world building was still very mystical. Clues and objects are paid in your deepest secrets, greatest fear, or even days of your life. There are tunnels that drive you mad and make you question what is real and what is simply part of the game. Caraval was just full of so many surprises that'll keep you turning the page. I had so many theories right from the very beginning that kept changing and evolving as the story progressed. I was so immersed in trying to crack the big mystery that was Caraval and Legend. This book will definitely leave you with more questions than answers in the end so prepare to be mind blown!
